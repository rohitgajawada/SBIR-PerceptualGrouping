We test our code on 19 classes of sketchy database. Can be extended to all 125 but we did only 19 for faster knn search time.
We use gco toolbox for graph cut optimization, edge linking and nmsthreshholding toolbox for edge thinning and edge segmenting toolbox for cutting a stroke into segments.
We use hed pretrained model for semantic edge detection.
